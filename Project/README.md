What I'd like to do is have a map that when the user hovers over the state name, a pop up will display. In this pop up I'd like to show data for how many injuries this state has on record or the type of accident it is, and how many of those injuries required hospitalization

It would be even better if you could add a story that you would like to tell with the data (e.g., the NPR story that I sent you earlier related to the impact of the ACA), or a hypothesis you would test with the map (e.g., the ACA has had a bigger impact on red states than blue states), or a user/application for the information (e.g., insurance companies can use this kind of information to assign risk).  If you have that kind of thing, it will help you make decisions on how to present data.

This data is owned by Federal_User_Community
This feature layer is derved from Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and provides information on serious workplace injuries in the utilities sector.
It is licensed under the ESRI MAster License Agreement
It was retrieved from ArcGIS online

Preprocessing:
I plotted the data in ArcMap and exported the data in the attribute table as a .csv
Then asked to have the .csv file converted into a geoJSON

Will be using the d3/API library
