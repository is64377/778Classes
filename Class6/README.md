Class 6

This repository contains the earthquakes in the last week from the USGS Earthquake API, plotted
by magnitude and depth into a scatterplot. 
The majority of earthquakes occur within a depth between 0-20km and a magnitude not generally greater than 2.5.

Additionally, the scatterplot is interactive. You can hover over any of the points to view the exact data values
for the depth and magnitude of the specific earthquake.

Story:
Here's the story of a lovely lady
who was bringing up three very lovely girls
all of them had hair of gold, like their mother.
the youngest one in curls.

Wait, I mean she had a scatterplot of global earthquake data spanning the last 7 days.
The quakes are plotted by magniture vs. depth.
Showdowboxes with these data will appear when the operator hovers the mouse over a plot point.
Both axes are labeled and the chart area is titled.
I would like to give Taylor credit because much of the structure this is based on is his.
I modified some of the conetnt and most of the appearances.
