Class 6

This repository contains the earthquakes in the last week from the USGS Earthquake API, plotted
by magnitude and depth into a scatterplot. 
The majority of earthquakes occur within a depth between 0-20km and a magnitude not generally greater than 2.5.

Additionally, the scatterplot is interactive. You can hover over any of the points to view the exact data values
for the depth and magnitude of the specific earthquake.
